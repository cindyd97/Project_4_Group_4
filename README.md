### Project Description/Outline:
We are a group of data analysts working for CMHDR Bank and we have been tasked with classifying the bank’s customers based on their credit score and credit information. We will also be creating a machine learning model that will predict whether a client’s loan application is a default or not based on specific features related to their demographics, education, payment history, annual income data, etc. Our presentation will utilize tableau to visualize the data of our customers and clients to convey our results and findings. 
Language: Python (google.colab)
